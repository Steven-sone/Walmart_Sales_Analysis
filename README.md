# Walmart_Sales_Data_Analysis_SQL_Project

## About

We are examining Walmart's sales data to pinpoint top-performing branches and products, analyze sales trends across different items, and gain insights into customer purchasing behavior. The main goal is to refine and optimize sales strategies. This analysis is based on a dataset from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition.

## Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to derive insights from Walmart's sales data by exploring the key factors that impact sales across different branches.

## About Data 

This project utilizes data from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting Competition, comprising sales transactions from three Walmart branches located in Mandalay, Yangon, and Naypyitaw. The dataset includes 17 columns and 1,000 rows.

## Analysis List 

1. Product Analysis
Conduct an analysis of the data to uncover insights into different product lines. The goal is to identify the top-performing product lines and highlight areas in need of improvement for other lines.

2. Sales Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to examine the sales trends of the product, addressing key questions related to sales performance. The results will help evaluate the effectiveness of existing sales strategies and identify areas where adjustments are needed to boost sales.

3. Customer Analysis
This analysis focuses on identifying distinct customer segments, understanding their purchasing behaviors, and evaluating the profitability linked to each segment.

## Approach Used

1. Data Wrangling
In this initial phase, the data is thoroughly examined to identify any NULL or missing values. Appropriate strategies are implemented to handle and replace these values effectively.

Build a Database:
Create a table and populate it with the data.
Select columns that contain NULL values. However, no NULL values are present in our database, as the table creation process specified NOT NULL for each field, automatically filtering out any NULL entries.

2. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering allows us to create new columns from existing data, adding more insights to the dataset.

Time of Day:
Add a new column called time_of_day to categorize sales based on Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. This helps us identify which part of the day generates the most sales.

Day of the Week:
Add a column named day_name that extracts the day of the week from the transaction date (e.g., Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri). This provides insights into the busiest days of the week for each branch.

Month of the Year:
Add a new column, month_name that extracts the month (e.g., Jan, Feb, Mar). This helps in determining which month generates the most sales and profit.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis is conducted to explore the dataset and provide valuable insights that address the project's objectives and key questions.
